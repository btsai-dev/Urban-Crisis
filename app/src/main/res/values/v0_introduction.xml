	<b>If you are currently involved in an emergency situation, ignore this page and tap the top left hand icon to bring up the menu.</b>\n\n
    This mobile app is a compilation of various information useful in a variety of emergency situations. While you will rarely, if ever, need the information contained, extra knowledge can never hurt.
	Information that is particularly important or information that may be needed immediately will be <b><i>bolded and italicized.</i></b>.\n\n
    This app uses content and images from several U.S. Army Field Manuals and governmental websites.\n\n
    The information here is to serve only as a guide. How you use the information and adapt it to different environments and situations relies on your creativity, skills, and capabilities. Being able to increase your chances of survival by a statistically significant or insignificant amount will depend on you.\n\n
