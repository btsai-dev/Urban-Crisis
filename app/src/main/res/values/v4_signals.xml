"<b><big>INTRODUCTION</big></b>
    Non-auditory signals are useful if one is trying to communicate at long ranges, there is too much noise to give verbal commands, of if keeping silent is necessary. Panel and body signals can also be used to signal for rescue.
 <b><big>PANEL SIGNALS</big></b>
    Panel signals, with a contrasting front and backside, may be used to convey messages. These panel messages come from the United States Army Field Manual 21-76."
