<b><big>INTRODUCTION</big></b>\n
    Amateur radio (also called ham radio)is the use of radio for non-commercial purposes. This is different from radio used for commercial broadcasting and by public safety personnel.\n\n
    As radio transmissions can reach foreign countries, governments require operators to have a license. All operators are given a call sign for identification, and they are allowed to build/modify transmission equipment for personal use within the amateur radio spectrum. Note that a <b><i>license is not necessary to listen to radio transmissions</i></b>.\n\n
    During a crisis, cell phone service may be down due to the increased number of people trying to call each other. However, amateur radio can always be used to transmit and receive messages. Just remember that anyone listening on the frequency you are transmitting can hear everything you say\n\n
