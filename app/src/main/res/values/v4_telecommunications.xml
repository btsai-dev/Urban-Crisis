"   <b><big>INTRODUCTION</big></b>
    So-called 'amateur radio' (also called ham radio) is basically the use of radio for non-commercial use (e.g, you're doing it for fun or you're testing out wireless equipment). This is different normal commercial broadcasting radio, public safety usage, or two-way radio usage.

    Because radio transmissions can travel to other countries, posing security risks, governments usually require operators to have a license. Every operator is given a call sign for identification, and are allowed to build or modify transmission equipment for personal use within the amateur radio spectrum. <b>You usually do not need a license to listen to radio transmissions.</b>

    During times of emergency, cell phone service may be down (an example being the 9/11 attacks) and the increased traffic of people trying to communicate with each other may be too much for cellular stations to handle. However, you can still use amateur radio to communicate. Even if you don't have a transmitter/aren't licensed, you can still listen to emergency radio broadcasts.
